## About me:

Iâ€™m a PhD student at the university of Toronto working to create advances at the intersection of machine learning and genomics. I am passionate about the subject because the consequences of discovery are so significant - biology is all around us and yet we understand so little of it.

Prior to starting my PhD I worked as a computational biologist at
Deep Genomics where I worked on translating foundational research in machine learning and genomics into pre-clinical applications.

My PhD projects are in the areas of self-supervised contrastive training, and data efficient learning for biological sequences. I am broadly curious and would love to discuss new and ongoing projects.

        <p>In this work we train a Mamba based model to learn mature mRNA representations using contrastive learning. Our augmentations consist of orthologous, and alternatively spliced transcripts.</p>

        <img src="./images/phenomolecular_retrieval.png" alt="Image Alt Text" />
        <p>We worked with folks from Recursion and Valence to create MolPhenix! It's a novel approach for learning the effects of concentration and molecules on cell morphology using large-scale phenomics data. To do that we innovate on the contrastive learning objective with the S2L loss.</p>
