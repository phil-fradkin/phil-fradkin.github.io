## About me

Iâ€™m a PhD student at the university of Toronto working to create advances at the intersection of machine learning and genomics. I am passionate about the subject because the consequences of discovery are so significant: biology is all around us and yet we understand so little of it.

Prior to starting my PhD I worked as a computational biologist at Deep Genomcs where I worked on translating foundational research in machine learning and genomics into pre-clinical applications.

My PhD projects are in the areas of self-supervised learning, geometric deep learning, and counterfactual model interpretability. I am broadly curious and would love to discuss new and ongoing projects

## Science communication

- I wrote a blog post about the 2017 paper: [Deep Variational Information Bottleneck](./science/information_bottleneck.md)
- I recorded a [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1aRzadwiHPS16DpUEdYlBb?si=4250cb59742f491c) with my friend Erik Drysdal covering advancements in genomics over the last 20 years, state of predictive system in molecular biology, and a little bit of personal history!
