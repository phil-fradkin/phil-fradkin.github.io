## About me:

Iâ€™m a PhD student at the university of Toronto working to create advances at the intersection of machine learning and genomics. I am passionate about the subject because the consequences of discovery are so significant - biology is all around us and yet we understand so little of it.

Prior to starting my PhD I worked as a computational biologist at
Deep Genomics where I worked on translating foundational research in machine learning and genomics into pre-clinical applications.

My PhD projects are in the areas of self-supervised contrastive training, and data efficient learning for biological sequences. I am broadly curious and would love to discuss new and ongoing projects.
