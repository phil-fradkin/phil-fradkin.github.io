## Books

- [2023/05] The Stand Stephen by King 5/5
    - I've had to stop reading this book a few times because if affected my mood so much. 
    - Slightly terrifying but a fantastic standoff between good an evil. 
    - Reminds me of lord of the rings in that way.
- [2023/06] Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir 3/5
    - It was really hard to peel away from this book.
    - The way science is depicted annoyed me. 
    - Everything worked out of the box and it was always super innovative instantly solving all the problems. 
- [2023/07] Faithful Robot by Stanislaw Lem 5/5
    - Absolutely hillarious short story. Couldn't stop laughing
- [2023/07] The rise and fall of D.O.D.O by Nicole Galland, Neal Stephenson 2/5
    - It started off so fun but man a huge portion of this book can be cut. 
    - So many really slow moments that don't really contribute to advancing the narrative.
- [2023/08] Children of time by Adrian Tchaikovsky 5/5
    - I was captivated by the story.
    - I really loved the weirdness of the characters.
    - I liked the unclear identity of the god like character circling the plannet.
- [2023/08] Children of Ruin by Adrian Tchaikovsky 4/5
    - I had to stop reading this one during Neurips rebuttal because it was putting me in a real weird mood.
    - The depiction here of the alien life-form felt like it related to the concept of zombies.
    - It was even more powerful, however, since there was an eagerness for it to understand it on a human level.
    - It felt somehow similar to Lem's writings like Solaris.
    - The end felt a little rushed and idealistic like Hyperion.
- [2023/09] When we cease to understand the world by Benjamin Labatut 4/5
    - A fun collection of stories imagining the lived experiences of scientists
    - Unclear how much of it is grounded in some sort of historical evidence
- [2023/09] Gardens of the Moon Steven Erikson 5/5
    - An awesome saga with beautiful world building.
    - Sort of tough to get into but the payoffs is fantastic.
- [2023/10] Deadhouse gates by Steven Erikson 5/5
    - I like that I don't have to learn new characters a bunch of them are there from the first book
    - I have a bit of a hard time keeping track of Jhugs, Trells, and Tlan Imass.
    - Being engrossed in these other world is really fun.
