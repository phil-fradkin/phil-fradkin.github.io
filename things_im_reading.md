- [2023/05] The Stand Stephen by King 5/5
    - I've had to stop reading this book a few times because if affected my mood so much. 
    - Slightly terrifying but an awesome standoff between good an evil. 
    - Reminds me of lord of the rings in a way.
- [2023/06] Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir 3/5
    - I couldn't stop reading it really addictive
    - The way science is depicted really annoyed me. 
    - Everything worked out of the box and it was always super innovative instantly solving all the problems. 
    - Unrealistic but really captivating.
- [2023/07] Faithful Robot by Stanislaw Lem 5/5
    - Absolutely hillarious short story. Couldn't stop laughing
- [2023/07] The rise and fall of D.O.D.O by Nicole Galland, Neal Stephenson 2/5
    - It started off so fun but man a huge portion of this book can be cut. 
    - So many really slow moments that don't really contribute to advancing the narrative.
- [2023/08] Children of time by Adrian Tchaikovsky 5/5
    - I was captivated by the story. The story is sort of doomer but I really loved the weirdness of it.
- [2023/08] Children of Ruin by Adrian Tchaikovsky 4/5
    - I've never been terrified of a book before. 
    - I had to stop reading this one during Neurips rebuttal because it was putting me in a real weird mood.
